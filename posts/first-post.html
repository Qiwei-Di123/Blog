                <p>Welcome to my blog! This is my first post. My goal is to share my personal understanding of various topics in a vivid and engaging writing style.</p>

                <h2>Why I Started This Blog</h2>
                <p>I'm not a very smart person. Whenever I learn something, I tend to forget it soon after, especially when I move on to other subjects. It's a pity that so many thoughts interesting or not get lost along the way. One solution is to write notes, which can organize ideas in a logical manner. But I want to do something more interesting, and more challenging.</p>

                <h2>What You Can Expect</h2>
                <p>I will write stories about what I've learned. I'll start in Chinese and use AI to help polish my sentences or translate them into English when needed. If I learn other languages later, I may also use AI to write in those languages.</p>

                <h2>About AI</h2>
                <p>I greatly appreciate the help of AI. I couldn't do this without it. While AI-generated writing still has its limitations, it helps me tremendously in expressing my thoughts.</p>
