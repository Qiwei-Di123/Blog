                <p>又是一个清晨，茜伸了伸懒腰，慢慢醒来。她的上班时间是十点，完全不必着急，可以悠然享受宁静的早晨——吃一顿精致的早餐，化一个淡妆，再慢悠悠地走去上班。</p>
                <p><em>Another morning arrives, and Qian stretches lazily as she slowly wakes up. Her shift doesn't start until ten, so there is no need to rush. She can leisurely enjoy a quiet morning—savoring a nice breakfast, putting on light makeup, then strolling unhurriedly to work.</em></p>

                <p>她是小城市的一名图书管理员。在这个AI已经普及、人们不再需要从书中汲取知识的年代，她的职位与主流追求毫无关联。但书籍毕竟承载着人们的记忆，作为精神遗产值得保留，这也是为什么还保留着这样一个闲职。</p>
                <p><em>She is a librarian in a small town. In an age where AI has become ubiquitous and people no longer need to draw knowledge from books, her position has nothing to do with mainstream pursuits. Yet books still carry people's memories, and as spiritual heritage, they deserve to be preserved—which is why this idle post still exists.</em></p>

                <p>茜今年二十二岁，刚刚大学毕业。在AI能够取代各行各业的大趋势下，她被家人劝说，选了最热门的绘画专业。即便在AI浪潮中，创意本身依然无价——创作一幅AI无法想到的画作，在如今的市场上可以卖到天价，且不可复制。一旦作品流入市场、被AI学习，就必须拿出新的创意。这也是为什么绘画会成为最热门的专业。</p>
                <p><em>Qian is twenty-two years old, having just graduated from university. In the prevailing trend where AI can replace every industry, her family persuaded her to choose the most popular major: painting. Even amid the AI wave, creativity itself remains priceless—a painting that AI cannot conceive can sell for astronomical prices and cannot be replicated. Once a work enters the market and is learned by AI, one must come up with new creative ideas. That is why painting has become the hottest major.</em></p>

                <p>可茜却不喜欢自己所学的东西。她不喜欢取悦别人，只喜欢用画笔记录日常所见的一草一木、一山一水。但在这个年代，这样的作品最不值钱。当她第一次课程作业提交了精心描绘的，家门口那株芍药花，却得了零分时，她便意识到自己不适合这个专业。</p>
                <p><em>But Qian doesn't like what she studies. She doesn't enjoy pleasing others; she only likes using her brush to record the everyday scenery she encounters—every blade of grass, every tree, every mountain and stream. Yet in this era, such works are worth the least. When she submits her first assignment—a carefully painted peony from her front yard—and receives a zero, she realizes she isn't suited for this major.</em></p>

                <p>"AI能够创作又如何？为什么表达自己的思想反而会被质疑？"她当时怎么也想不明白。</p>
                <p><em>"So what if AI can create? Why should expressing one's own thoughts be questioned?" She cannot understand it at all back then.</em></p>

                <p>但不管怎样，那都是四年前的事了。如今的她已经毕业，毅然放弃了大城市开出的高薪设计师职位，回到家乡，成为了一名图书管理员。说实话，她从来没有真正使用过书。她只是觉得，这样一份清闲的工作，薪水虽然微薄却足以生活，对于她这个追求自由的年轻灵魂而言，已经足够了。</p>
                <p><em>But regardless, that is all four years ago now. She has graduated and resolutely turns down a high-paying designer position in the big city, returning to her hometown to become a librarian. To be honest, she has never really used books herself. She simply feels that such a leisurely job, with a modest but livable salary, is enough for a young soul like her who seeks freedom.</em></p>

                <p>图书馆里很少有人来，她的工作不过是每天巡视一圈，确保那些几乎无人问津的古书不被虫蛀。除此之外，她还负责信件分发。虽然写信的实用功能早已消退，但在商业宣传的推动下，一些年轻人仍热衷于用手写信的方式，向亲人、朋友和爱人表达情感。而她所在的图书馆除了寄信，还开设了插画业务，承诺在绝不使用AI的前提下，为手写信配上手绘插图——这也是茜能够顺利入职的原因。她喜欢这份工作，很大程度上是因为她喜欢看到自己的手绘被人欣赏、收到别人的喜爱。当然，需要这项服务的人并不多，所以她的生活大多时候十分清闲。</p>
                <p><em>Few people come to the library. Her job is merely to make daily rounds, ensuring that the ancient books—which almost no one reads—aren't eaten by insects. Beyond that, she is in charge of mail distribution. Although the practical function of letter-writing has long faded, driven by commercial promotion, some young people still love expressing their feelings to family, friends, and lovers through handwritten letters. Her library, besides mailing letters, also offers an illustration service, promising to add hand-drawn artwork to letters without ever using AI—which is why Qian is able to get this job. She loves this work, largely because she enjoys seeing her drawings appreciated and receiving others' affection. Of course, not many people need this service, so her life is mostly quite leisurely.</em></p>
                <p>可是今天，她却发现，收到的其中一封信的收件人竟是她自己。</p>
                <p><em>But today, she discovers that one of the letters she receives is addressed to herself.</em></p>

                <p>"可爱的茜，虽然你现在还不认识我，但请不要担心，我绝无恶意。命运的齿轮注定会将你我连在一起，我相信，终有一天我们会见面，只是时候未到。曾经的你嘱托我，一定要把接下来的内容讲给你听。可如今，我们只能通过这短短的书信沟通，如何才能写下那么长的故事呢？一定是你在考验我吧。但我接受挑战——一封写不下，我就分成许多封。因为这是我最重要的人让我许下的承诺，无论如何，我都要为她实现心愿。"</p>
                <p><em>"Dear Qian, although you don't know me yet, please don't worry—I mean no harm. The gears of fate are destined to bring us together, and I believe that one day we will meet, though the time has not yet come. Once upon a time, you entrusted me with a task: to tell you what comes next. But now, we can only communicate through these brief letters. How can I possibly write down such a long story? You must be testing me. But I accept the challenge—if one letter isn't enough, I'll write many. Because this is a promise I made to the most important person in my life, and no matter what, I will fulfill her wish."</em></p>

                <p>"茜，当然，我的承诺与你无关，你也不必因此承受任何负担。但我相信，我的信不会占用你太多时间，只需要你在工作时稍加思索，便能帮你打发那些空虚的摸鱼时光。而且，她曾向我保证，你会享受这个过程的。"</p>
                <p><em>"Qian, of course, my promise has nothing to do with you, and you needn't bear any burden because of it. But I believe my letters won't take much of your time—just a bit of thought during work, enough to help you pass those idle moments. Besides, she once assured me that you would enjoy this."</em></p>

                <p>"所以，我还寄了另一封信。如果你完全不想读，我可以接受，你可以直接把它丢掉，我便不再联系你。但如果不是这样，那我希望我们能维持这个小小的游戏，一直到我们见面的那一天。"</p>
                <p><em>"So I've sent another letter as well. If you don't want to read it at all, I accept that—you can simply throw it away, and I won't contact you again. But if not, then I hope we can keep this little game going, until the day we finally meet."</em></p>

                <p>这封信上并没有寄信人的名字。而当茜翻找时，果然还有另一封写着她名字的信。那封信的寄件人署名是——芸。</p>
                <p><em>There is no sender's name on this letter. But when Qian searches through the mail, she indeed finds another letter addressed to her. The sender's name on that one is—Yun.</em></p>
